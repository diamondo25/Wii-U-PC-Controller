# Wii U PC Controller
Control your PC with your Wii U gamepad controller!

The goal of this project is to be able to control your computers mouse using your Wii U gamepad. Currently you can see some basic debugging information on both the PC server and Wii U gamepad as well as perform left and right clicks using ZL / ZR. Next, I will implement moving of the mouse using the analog sticks.

Once mouse control is fully implemented I will begin to explore the possibility of a virtual keyboard.
